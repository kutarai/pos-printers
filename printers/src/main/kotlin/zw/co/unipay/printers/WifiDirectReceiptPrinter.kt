 * Wi-Fi P2P peer: it is discovered, a group is formed with it, and it answers at the group owner's
 * address. The second is really a small access point with a fixed address, joined from Android's
 * own Wi-Fi settings; for those the operator types the address and no peer is involved.
 *
 * The group is deliberately formed with a group owner intent of zero. Forming it the other way
 * round works, but leaves the till as owner with no way to learn the address the printer was given,
 * which is a failure that only shows up when a customer is waiting.
 *
 * As with Bluetooth, nothing here is allowed to break a sale: every path returns a [PrintResult].
